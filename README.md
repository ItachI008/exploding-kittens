## Setting Up the Game Locally


### For Node.js (React Frontend):
1. Begin by installing dependencies: `npm install`
2. Launch the frontend server: `npm start`
3. Access the game at: `http://localhost:3000`

### For Go Lang (Backend):
1. Initiate by installing dependencies: `go mod tidy`
2. Compile the Go server: `go build -o main`
3. Kickstart the server: `go run main.go`

Redis, the heartbeat of our database operations, adds a layer of efficiency to our backend. Let's walk through integrating Redis with our project.

## Integrating Redis Database (Backend)

### Step 1: Redis Installation

Start by installing Redis on your system. You can obtain Redis from the official website or via package managers like `apt` or `brew` based on your operating system.

### Step 2: Launch Redis Server

Initiate the Redis server on your local machine. Execute the following command in your terminal:


redis-server


This command launches the Redis server with default settings.

### Step 3: Terminate Redis Connection

Remember to gracefully terminate the Redis connection once you're done:

ctrl+c should do the trick üòâ

And voil√†! You've seamlessly incorporated Redis into your project, empowering it with enhanced data management capabilities.
